# MSc Dissertation Draft – Driver Risk Prediction System

## Chapter 1 – Introduction

Road safety remains a critical global challenge. Human driver behaviour is a major factor in traffic accidents. This project investigates the feasibility of using deep learning techniques to predict unsafe driving events using vehicle telemetry data.

The goal of this study is to design and evaluate a predictive model capable of classifying driving events as safe or risky.

## Chapter 2 – Literature Review

Prior research demonstrates the effectiveness of neural networks for driving behaviour analysis. Many studies have applied machine learning for anomaly detection in intelligent transportation systems.

## Chapter 3 – Methodology

A supervised learning approach was used. A dataset containing real-time driving attributes was cleaned, transformed, and used to train a multi-layer neural network using DL4J.

## Chapter 4 – Experiments

Hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of hidden layers were tuned.

## Chapter 5 – Results

Results show the practical feasibility of driver risk prediction with acceptable accuracy.

## Chapter 6 – Conclusion

The project demonstrates that Java-based deep learning systems can effectively support intelligent driver risk modelling.
